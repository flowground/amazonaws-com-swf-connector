A <code>WorkflowExecutionContinuedAsNew</code> event is recorded in the history.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>FailWorkflowExecution</code> – Closes the workflow execution and records a <code>WorkflowExecutionFailed</code> event in the history.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>RecordMarker</code> – Records a <code>MarkerRecorded</code> event in the history. Markers can be used for adding custom information in the history for instance to let deciders know that they don't need to look at the history beyond the marker event.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>RequestCancelActivityTask</code> – Attempts to cancel a previously scheduled activity task. If the activity task was scheduled but has not been assigned to a worker, then it is canceled. If the activity task was already assigned to a worker, then the worker is informed that cancellation has been requested in the response to <a>RecordActivityTaskHeartbeat</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>RequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecution</code> – Requests that a request be made to cancel the specified external workflow execution and records a <code>RequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecutionInitiated</code> event in the history.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>ScheduleActivityTask</code> – Schedules an activity task.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>SignalExternalWorkflowExecution</code> – Requests a signal to be delivered to the specified external workflow execution and records a <code>SignalExternalWorkflowExecutionInitiated</code> event in the history.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>StartChildWorkflowExecution</code> – Requests that a child workflow execution be started and records a <code>StartChildWorkflowExecutionInitiated</code> event in the history.

Some decisions might not make sense in the current context of the workflow execution and therefore fails.</p> </li> <li> <p>A limit on your account was reached.</p> </li> <li> <p>The decision lacks sufficient permissions.</p> </li> </ul> <p>One of the following events might be added to the history to indicate an error. The event attribute's <code>cause</code> parameter indicates the cause. If <code>cause</code> is set to <code>OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED</code>, the decision failed because it lacked sufficient permissions.

This could happen if the activity type specified in the decision isn't registered, is in a deprecated state, or the decision isn't properly configured.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>RequestCancelActivityTaskFailed</code> – A <code>RequestCancelActivityTask</code> decision failed. This could happen if there is no open activity task with the specified activityId.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>StartTimerFailed</code> – A <code>StartTimer</code> decision failed. This could happen if there is another open timer with the same timerId.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>CancelTimerFailed</code> – A <code>CancelTimer</code> decision failed. This could happen if there is no open timer with the specified timerId.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>StartChildWorkflowExecutionFailed</code> – A <code>StartChildWorkflowExecution</code> decision failed.

An <code>UnhandledDecision</code> fault is returned if a workflow closing decision is specified and a signal or activity event had been added to the history while the decision task was being performed by the decider. Unlike the above situations which are logic issues, this fault is always possible because of race conditions in a distributed system. The right action here is to call <a>RespondDecisionTaskCompleted</a> without any decisions. This would result in another decision task with these new events included in the history. The decider should handle the new events and may decide to close the workflow execution.</p> </note> <p> <b>How to Code a Decision</b> </p> <p>You code a decision by first setting the decision type field to one of the above decision values, and then set the corresponding attributes field shown below:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code> <a>ScheduleActivityTaskDecisionAttributes</a> </code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code> <a>RequestCancelActivityTaskDecisionAttributes</a> </code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code> <a>CompleteWorkflowExecutionDecisionAttributes</a> </code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code> <a>FailWorkflowExecutionDecisionAttributes</a> </code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code> <a>CancelWorkflowExecutionDecisionAttributes</a> </code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code> <a>ContinueAsNewWorkflowExecutionDecisionAttributes</a> </code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code> <a>RecordMarkerDecisionAttributes</a> </code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code> <a>StartTimerDecisionAttributes</a> </code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code> <a>CancelTimerDecisionAttributes</a> </code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code> <a>SignalExternalWorkflowExecutionDecisionAttributes</a> </code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code> <a>RequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecutionDecisionAttributes</a> </code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code> <a>StartChildWorkflowExecutionDecisionAttributes</a> </code> </p> </li> </ul>",

This overrides the defaultTaskPriority specified when registering the workflow type. Valid values are integers that range from Java's <code>Integer.MIN_VALUE</code> (-2147483648) to <code>Integer.MAX_VALUE</code> (2147483647). Higher numbers indicate higher priority.</p> <p>For more information about setting task priority, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/programming-priority.html\">Setting Task Priority</a> in the <i>Amazon SWF Developer Guide</i>.</p>",
